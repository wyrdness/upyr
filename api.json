      "full": "The **upyr** (also spelled *upir*, *upior*, or *wampir*) is an ancient Slavic undead creature that serves as the direct precursor to the modern Western vampire. Originating in Eastern European folklore centuries before Bram Stoker's Dracula, the upyr represents one of humanity's oldest documented beliefs in the returning dead. Unlike the romanticized vampires of popular culture, traditional upyri were bloated, ruddy corpses that terrorized villages by draining blood and life force from the living. The word \\\"upyr\\\" first appeared in written form in 1047 CE in a manuscript referring to a Russian prince as \\\"Upir Lichy\\\" (Wicked Vampire), making it one of the earliest documented uses of vampire terminology. These creatures were believed to rise from their graves at night to prey upon family members, livestock, and entire communities, spreading disease and death in their wake."
